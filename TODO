    -- Add range enhancers
    -- Allow targeting of blocks? nahh or should we?
    -- Custom GUI for spellbook selection
    -- YOU BUILD THE SPELLS
    -- Standardize constructors (plugin,player or reverse or etc)
    -- Spell idea: sniperfire. fires an arrow with 100% accuracy.

    -- The location of the HUD additions is sometimes weird (Category: Spout Limitations)

Spells 2.0
by hgilman, originally by the Aor Minecraft Devteam

Welcome to the magical world of Spells.


TODO:
    -- Incorporate the tareting functions into the spells
    -- Create a visual notifier of when something is targeted (think EVE)
    -- Make the targeting label bigger and closer on the screen, also not so far in the corner
    -- Use an advanced spout plugin/something that can make custom items work nicer than raw Spout ******
    -- Add range enhancers
    -- Allow targeting of blocks? nahh or should we?
    -- Custom GUI for spellbook selection
    -- YOU BUILD THE SPELLS
    -- Standardize constructors (plugin,player or reverse or etc)

KNOWN BUGS:
    -- The scepters aren't supposed to stack (Category: Spout Limitations)
    -- When the scepter is dropped, a weird items.png graphic shows up (Category: Spout Limitations)
    -- The location of the HUD additions is sometimes weird (Category: Spout Limitations)

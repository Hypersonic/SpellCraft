SpellCraft
by hgilman, originally by the Aor Minecraft Devteam

Once upon a time, the administrators of the glorious realm of Aor Minecraft decreed that a new
plugin was to be built, a plugin that would awe the dwellers of Aor with dazzling effects and
magnificent power. This plugin, originally known as SimplePlugin but later called Spells, lived up
to these high expectations. Unfortunately, it was abandoned when the economy of Aor Minecraft
crashed and the admins were thrown out of power.

But now, one of those admins has revived Spells, not simply to be another "Magic Plugin" but as a
fully-fledged API, so that other programmers might bring their powers to the table and build their
own spells within its powerful framework.

Ladies and gentlement, I give you... SpellCraft!

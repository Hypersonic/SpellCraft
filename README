Spells 2.0
by hgilman, originally by the Aor Minecraft Devteam

Welcome to the magical world of Spells.


TODO:
    -- See if it's possible to get the scepter graphic working every time
    -- Incorporate the tareting functions into the spells
    -- Remove all traes of gold hoeage from the code
    -- Create a visual notifier of when something is targeted (think EVE)
    -- Make the targeting label bigger and closer on the screen, also not so far in the corner

KNOWN BUGS:
    -- The scepters aren't supposed to stack (Category: Spout Limitations)
    -- When the scepter is dropped, a weird items.png graphic shows up (Category: Spout Limitations)
